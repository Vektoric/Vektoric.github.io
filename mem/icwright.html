          Irvine Cornelius Wright, colloquially known as "Irvine", formally known as "I. C. Wright". He is most known for pwning myriads of noobs worldwide. Antecedent to the Conjuring of the Galaxy Brain Entity, sat in nil I. C. Wright until opportunity of light presented itself. Among the laymen, hearsay spoke of geneses by inhuman hands. Yet, reality contradicts in greatest measure. It was a hand from earth, a milk-drinking coffee-hating beastly hand. Beyond the nil-mist sat I. C. Wright with his mouth shut tight, yet spoke loudest. His words begat words recursively to create the observable universe. The creation of Galaxy Brain required far more than mere words. The creation of Galaxy Brain necessisated the merging of triforces to birth the whole. Only then Galaxy Brain could exist. Unbeknownst to I. C. Wright, The Mind, Body, and Soul had already gathered, yet what blockades the convergence of the presence into the future had been nothing but the press of a button.<b> Hop VC.
